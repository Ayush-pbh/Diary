See you just have to copy you fav pictures(.jpg) on which you would like to encrypt text, to the main/static/data/image/
Be sure to rename them to a fashion of img(1).jpg, img(2).jpg, ... img(n).jpg
These pictures will not affected in any sense.
The webapp stores a copy of the image in the main/static/data/entries folder which have your encrypted text.
